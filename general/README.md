# General (All Use Cases) <!-- omit in toc -->

These configurations and installs are my preferences regardless of what the device will be used for. At the OS level they lay the foundation for ease of use in the topics of eye strain, screen real estate, and touch accessibility. At the application level they set you up for validating machine performance, establishing communication capabilities and security best practices.

## Software <!-- omit in toc -->
### ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
MacOS has a built in tool for capturing screen content called **Screenshot**. I frequently take clips of my screen to include in things like documentation, emails, or just to show a colleague or friend some content. You can take a quick screenshot by pressing the key combination **â‡§âŒ˜4** and then clicking to drag around the area you want to snip. By default Keep screenshots from cluttering your desktop by creating a folder for them
  - Press **â‡§âŒ˜5** then under options > Save To > Other Location
  - Create a new folder:  
    `~/Documents/Screenshots`
**Geekbench**
  - make sure you didnâ€™t get a lemon
  - Does your score match other uploads for your same machine?
